# WebApplicationSiminn

Blazor server that talks to a class library that handles API calls. Data is then grraphed in a line chart using Radzen.

## Install guide

- Clone this repository onto your machine and open with Visual Studio.
- You probably will need to replace the header key in the class *DataAccessLayer* with your own *X-Rapid-Key*.
- I used version 5.0 of .NET so you will probably also need that.
